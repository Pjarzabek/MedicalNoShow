# Medical Appointment No-Show

*Is it possible to predict whether the patient will show up for appointment?*

In this project I used scikit-learn library to build machine learning models which will predict if a patient will show up for their medical appointment. The dataset is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and is available [over here](https://github.com/Pjarzabek/MedicalNoShow/blob/master/Appointments.csv). 

If you want to check my results, take a look at this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Pjarzabek/MedicalNoShow/blob/master/Medical%20Appointments%20No%20Show.ipynb).
